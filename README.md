### Collector for FTS's Datasets
Collector designed to collect the FTS datasets from the [FTS](https://fts.unocha.org/) website.

### Usage

    python run.py

You will need to have a file called .hdxkey in your home directory containing only your HDX key for the register script to run. That script was created to automatically register datasets on the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](http://data.humdata.org/) project.
